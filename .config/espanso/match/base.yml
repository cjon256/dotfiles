# # espanso match file
#
# # For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/
#
# # You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# # that will be available in every application when using espanso.
#
# # Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# # it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
#   # Simple text replacement
#   - trigger: ":espanso"
#     replace: "Hi there!"
#
#
#   # But matches can also be dynamic:
#
#   # Print the current date
#   - trigger: ":date"
#     replace: "{{mydate}}"
#     vars:
#       - name: mydate
#         type: date
#         params:
#           format: "%m/%d/%Y"
#
#   # Print the output of a shell command
#   - trigger: ":shell"
#     replace: "{{output}}"
#     vars:
#       - name: output
#         type: shell
#         params:
#           cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
#
#   # And much more! For more information, visit the docs: https://espanso.org/docs/
#
#   - trigger: ";hello"
#     replace: "hi there"

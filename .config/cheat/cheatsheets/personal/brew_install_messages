    ==> Pouring zlib--1.3.arm64_ventura.bottle.tar.gz
    ==> Caveats
    zlib is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
    because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
    parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

    For compilers to find zlib you may need to set:
      export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/zlib/lib"
        export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/zlib/include"

        For pkg-config to find zlib you may need to set:
          export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/zlib/lib/pkgconfig"
